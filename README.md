This project involves customer segmentation based on purchase history using the K-means clustering algorithm. The dataset includes various features like customer ID, gender, age, annual income and spending score. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to better understand their behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

The K-means algorithm helps in categorizing customers into different segments by clustering similar data points together. The project includes data preprocessing steps, applying the K-means algorithm, and analyzing the resulting clusters to draw insights about each customer segment.

To use the project, clone the repository, install the required packages, and open the Jupyter Notebook file.
